1. Add a video file (preferably < 10 seconds) to the static directory
2. Navigate to the server directory and run the following on the shell:

    ```shell
    node server.js
    ```

3. Navigate to localhost:9000

It is going to be really laggy and will play in a loop so it is advised to close the tab immediately or to not try running the project at all.
